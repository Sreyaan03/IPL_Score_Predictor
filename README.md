IPL Score Predictor using Keras
This project is an IPL (Indian Premier League) score predictor built with Keras. It predicts the final target score a team might set in a T20 match based on real-time match inputs.

 Dataset
The dataset was generated using web scraping techniques to collect historical IPL match data. Key features include:

Current score

Overs completed

Wickets fallen

Batsmen and bowler details

Match venue and conditions

 Model
A regression-based neural network was developed using the Keras Sequential API. It learns scoring patterns and predicts the final score based on the current game state.

 Features
Real-time target score prediction

Built using deep learning with Keras

Custom dataset created via web scraping

This project demonstrates how machine learning and data engineering can be used in sports analytics to generate meaningful insights
